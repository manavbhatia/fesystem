  /*
   c++ version of ARPACK routine dsaupd that implements a variant of
   the Lanczos method.  This method has been designed to compute
   approximations to a few eigenpairs of a linear operator OP that is
   real and symmetric with respect to a real positive semi-definite
   symmetric matrix B, i.e.
   
   B*OP = (OP')*B.
   
   where A' denotes transpose of A. In the standard eigenproblem B is
   the identity matrix. Another way to express this condition is
   
   < x,OPy > = < OPx,y >  where < z,w > = z'Bw.
   
   The computed approximate eigenvalues are called Ritz values and
   the corresponding approximate eigenvectors are called Ritz vectors.
   
   saupp is usually called iteratively to solve one of the
   following problems:
   
   Mode 1:  A*x = lambda*x, A symmetric
   ===> OP = A  and  B = I.
   
   Mode 2:  A*x = lambda*M*x, A symmetric, M symmetric positive definite
   ===> OP = inv[M]*A  and  B = M.
   ===> (If M can be factored see remark 3 below)
   
   Mode 3:  K*x = lambda*M*x, K symmetric, M symmetric positive semi-definite
   ===> OP = (inv[K - sigma*M])*M  and  B = M.
   ===> Shift-and-Invert mode
   
   Mode 4:  K*x = lambda*KG*x, K symmetric positive semi-definite,
   KG symmetric indefinite
   ===> OP = (inv[K - sigma*KG])*K  and  B = K.
   ===> Buckling mode
   
   Mode 5:  A*x = lambda*M*x, A symmetric, M symmetric positive semi-definite
   ===> OP = inv[A - sigma*M]*[A + sigma*M]  and  B = M.
   ===> Cayley transformed mode
   
   NOTE: The action of w <- inv[A - sigma*M]*v or w <- inv[M]*v should be
   accomplished either by a direct method using a sparse matrix
   factorization and solving
   
   [A - sigma*M]*w = v  or M*w = v,
   
   or through an iterative method for solving these systems.  If an
   iterative method is used, the convergence test must be more
   stringent than the accuracy requirements for the eigenvalue
   approximations.
   
   Parameters:
   
   ido     (Input / Output) Reverse communication flag.  ido must be
   zero on the first call to saupp.  ido will be set
   internally to indicate the type of operation to be
   performed.  Control is then given back to the calling
   routine which has the responsibility to carry out the
   requested operation and call saupp with the result. The
   operand is given in workd[ipntr[1]], the result must be
   put in workd[ipntr[2]]. (If Mode = 2 see remark 5 below).
   ido =  0: first call to the reverse communication interface.
   ido = -1: compute  Y = OP * X  where
   ipntr[1] is the pointer into workd for X,
   ipntr[2] is the pointer into workd for Y.
   This is for the initialization phase to force the
   starting vector into the range of OP.
   ido =  1: compute  Y = OP * X where
   ipntr[1] is the pointer into workd for X,
   ipntr[2] is the pointer into workd for Y.
   In mode 3,4 and 5, the vector B * X is already
   available in workd[ipntr[3]].  It does not
   need to be recomputed in forming OP * X.
   ido =  2: compute  Y = B * X  where
   ipntr[1] is the pointer into workd for X,
   ipntr[2] is the pointer into workd for Y.
   ido =  3: compute the iparam[8] shifts where
   ipntr[11] is the pointer into workl for
   placing the shifts. See remark 6 below.
   ido = 99: done.
   bmat    (Input) bmat specifies the type of the matrix B that defines
   the semi-inner product for the operator OP.
   bmat = 'I' -> standard eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*x;
   bmat = 'G' -> generalized eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*B*x.
   n       (Input) Dimension of the eigenproblem.
   nev     (Input) Number of eigenvalues to be computed. 0 < nev < n.
   which   (Input) Specify which of the Ritz values of OP to compute.
   'LA' - compute the nev largest (algebraic) eigenvalues.
   'SA' - compute the nev smallest (algebraic) eigenvalues.
   'LM' - compute the nev largest (in magnitude) eigenvalues.
   'SM' - compute the nev smallest (in magnitude) eigenvalues.
   'BE' - compute nev eigenvalues, half from each end of the
   spectrum.  When NEV is odd, compute one more from the
   high end than from the low end.
   (see remark 1 below)
   tol     (Input) Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of the
   Ritz value is considered acceptable if BOUNDS[i] <=
   tol*abs(RITZ[i]). If tol<=0.0 is passed, the machine
   precision as computed by the LAPACK auxiliary subroutine
   _LAMCH is used.
   resid   (Input / Output) Array of length n.
   On input:
   If info==0, a random initial residual vector is used.
   If info!=0, resid contains the initial residual vector,
   possibly from a previous run.
   On output:
   resid contains the final residual vector.
   ncv     (Input) Number of Lanczos vectors that are generated at each
   iteration. After the startup phase in which nev Lanczos
   vectors are generated, the algorithm generates ncv-nev
   Lanczos vectors at each subsequent update iteration. Most of
   the cost in generating each Lanczos vector is in the
   matrix-vector product OP*x. (See remark 4 below).
   V       (Output) Double precision array of length ncv*n+1. V contains
   the ncv Lanczos basis vectors. The first element V[0] is never
   referenced.
   ldv     (Input) Dimension of the basis vectors contianed in V. This
   parameter MUST be set to n.
   iparam  (Input / Output) Array of length 12.
   iparam[1]  = ISHIFT: method for selecting the implicit shifts.
   The shifts selected at each iteration are used to restart
   the Arnoldi iteration in an implicit fashion.
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   ISHIFT = 0: the shifts are provided by the user via
   reverse communication.  The NCV eigenvalues of
   the current tridiagonal matrix T are returned in
   the part of workl array corresponding to RITZ.
   See remark 6 below.
   ISHIFT = 1: exact shifts with respect to the reduced
   tridiagonal matrix T.  This is equivalent to
   restarting the iteration with a starting vector
   that is a linear combination of Ritz vectors
   associated with the "wanted" Ritz values.
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   iparam[2] is no longer referenced.
   iparam[3]  = MXITER
   On INPUT:  maximum number of Arnoldi update iterations allowed.
   On OUTPUT: actual number of Arnoldi update iterations taken.
   iparam[4]  = NB: blocksize to be used in the recurrence.
   The code currently works only for NB = 1.
   iparam[5]  = NCONV: number of "converged" Ritz values.
   This represents the number of Ritz values that satisfy
   the convergence criterion.
   iparam[6] is no longer referenced.
   iparam[7]  = MODE. On INPUT determines what type of
   eigenproblem is being solved. Must be 1,2,3,4,5.
   iparam[8]  = NP. When ido = 3 and the user provides shifts
   through reverse communication (iparam[1]=0), saupp returns
   NP, the number of shifts the user is to provide.
   0 < NP <=ncv-nev. See Remark 6 below.
   iparam[9]  =  total number of OP*x operations.
   iparam[10] = total number of B*x operations if bmat='G'.
   iparam[11] = total number of steps of re-orthogonalization.
   ipntr   (Output) Array of length 12. Pointer to mark the starting
   locations in the workd and workl arrays for matrices/vectors
   used by the Lanczos iteration.
   ipntr[1] : pointer to the current operand vector X in workd.
   ipntr[2] : pointer to the current result vector Y in workd.
   ipntr[3] : pointer to the vector B * X in workd when used in
   the shift-and-invert mode.
   ipntr[4] : pointer to the next available location in workl
   that is untouched by the program.
   ipntr[5] : pointer to the ncv by 2 tridiagonal matrix T in
   workl.
   ipntr[6] : pointer to the ncv RITZ values array in workl.
   ipntr[7] : pointer to the Ritz estimates in array workl
   associated with the Ritz values located in RITZ
   in workl.
   ipntr[11]: pointer to the np shifts in workl. See Remark 6.
   Note: ipntr[8:10] is only referenced by seupp. See Remark 2.
   ipntr[8] : pointer to the ncv RITZ values of the original
   system.
   ipntr[9] : pointer to the ncv corresponding error bounds.
   ipntr[10]: pointer to the ncv by ncv matrix of eigenvectors
   of the tridiagonal matrix T. Only referenced by
   seupp if RVEC = TRUE. See Remarks.
   workd   (Input / Output) Array of length 3*N+1.
   Distributed array to be used in the basic Arnoldi iteration
   for reverse communication.  The user should not use workd as
   temporary workspace during the iteration. Upon termination
   workd[1:n] contains B*resid[1:n]. If the Ritz vectors are
   desired subroutine seupp uses this output.
   workl   (Output) Array of length lworkl+1. Private (replicated) array
   on each PE or array allocated on the front end.
   lworkl  (Input) lworkl must be at least ncv*(ncv+8).
   info    (Input / Output) On input, if info = 0, a randomly initial
   residual vector is used, otherwise resid contains the initial
   residual vector, possibly from a previous run.
   On output, info works as a error flag:
   =  0   : Normal exit.
   =  1   : Maximum number of iterations taken. All possible
   eigenvalues of OP has been found. iparam[5]
   returns the number of wanted converged Ritz values.
   =  3   : No shifts could be applied during a cycle of the
   Implicitly restarted Arnoldi iteration. One
   possibility is to increase the size of NCV relative
   to nev. See remark 4 below.
   = -1   : n must be positive.
   = -2   : nev must be positive.
   = -3   : ncv must satisfy nev < ncv <= n.
   = -4   : The maximum number of Arnoldi update iterations allowed
   must be greater than zero.
   = -5   : which must be one of 'LM', 'SM', 'LA', 'SA' or 'BE'.
   = -6   : bmat must be one of 'I' or 'G'.
   = -7   : Length of private work array workl is not sufficient.
   = -8   : Error return from trid. eigenvalue calculation;
   Informational error from LAPACK routine dsteqr.
   = -9   : Starting vector is zero.
   = -10  : iparam[7] must be 1,2,3,4,5.
   = -11  : iparam[7] = 1 and bmat = 'G' are incompatible.
   = -12  : iparam[1] must be equal to 0 or 1.
   = -13  : nev and which = 'BE' are incompatible.
   = -9999: Could not build an Arnoldi factorization. iparam[5]
   returns the size of the current Arnoldi factorization.
   The user is advised to check that enough workspace
   and array storage has been allocated.
   
   Remarks:
   1. The converged Ritz values are always returned in ascending
   algebraic order.  The computed Ritz values are approximate
   eigenvalues of OP.  The selection of "which" should be made
   with this in mind when Mode = 3,4,5.  After convergence,
   approximate eigenvalues of the original problem may be obtained
   with the ARPACK subroutine seupp.
   2. If the Ritz vectors corresponding to the converged Ritz values are
   needed, the user must call seupp immediately following completion
   of saupp. This is new starting with version 2.1 of ARPACK.
   3. If M can be factored into a Cholesky factorization M = LL'
   then Mode = 2 should not be selected.  Instead one should use
   Mode = 1 with  OP = inv(L)*A*inv(L').  Appropriate triangular
   linear systems should be solved with L and L' rather
   than computing inverses.  After convergence, an approximate
   eigenvector z of the original problem is recovered by solving
   L'z = x  where x is a Ritz vector of OP.
   4. At present there is no a-priori analysis to guide the selection
   of ncv relative to nev.  The only formal requrement is that
   ncv > nev. However, it is recommended that ncv >= 2*nev. If many
   problems of the same type are to be solved, one should experiment
   with increasing ncv while keeping nev fixed for a given test
   problem. This will usually decrease the required number of OP*x
   operations but it also increases the work and storage required to
   maintain the orthogonal basis vectors.   The optimal "cross-over"
   with respect to CPU time is problem dependent and must be
   determined empirically.
   5. If iparam[7] = 2 then in the Reverse commuication interface the
   user must do the following. When ido = 1, Y = OP * X is to be
   computed. When iparam[7] = 2 OP = inv(B)*A. After computing A*X
   the user must overwrite X with A*X. Y is then the solution to the
   linear set of equations B*Y = A*X.
   6. When iparam[1] = 0, and ido = 3, the user needs to provide the
   NP = iparam[8] shifts in locations:
   1   workl[ipntr[11]]
   2   workl[ipntr[11]+1]
   .
   .
   .
   NP  workl[ipntr[11]+NP-1].
   The eigenvalues of the current tridiagonal matrix are located in
   workl[ipntr[6]] through workl[ipntr[6]+ncv]. They are in the
   order defined by which. The associated Ritz estimates are located in
   workl[ipntr[8]], workl[ipntr[8]+1], ... , workl[ipntr[8]+ncv-1].

  /*
   c++ version of ARPACK routine dseupd.
   This subroutine returns the converged approximations to eigenvalues
   of A*z = lambda*B*z and (optionally):
   
   (1) the corresponding approximate eigenvectors,
   (2) an orthonormal (Lanczos) basis for the associated approximate
   invariant subspace,
   
   There is negligible additional cost to obtain eigenvectors. An orthonormal
   (Lanczos) basis is always computed.  There is an additional storage cost
   of n*nev if both are requested (in this case a separate array Z must be
   supplied).
   These quantities are obtained from the Lanczos factorization computed
   by saupp for the linear operator OP prescribed by the MODE selection
   (see IPARAM[7] in saupp documentation). saupp must be called before
   this routine is called. These approximate eigenvalues and vectors are
   commonly called Ritz values and Ritz vectors respectively.  They are
   referred to as such in the comments that follow. The computed orthonormal
   basis for the invariant subspace corresponding to these Ritz values is
   referred to as a Lanczos basis.
   See documentation in the header of the subroutine dsaupp for a definition
   of OP as well as other terms and the relation of computed Ritz values
   and vectors of OP with respect to the given problem  A*z = lambda*B*z.
   The approximate eigenvalues of the original problem are returned in
   ascending algebraic order.  The user may elect to call this routine
   once for each desired Ritz vector and store it peripherally if desired.
   There is also the option of computing a selected set of these vectors
   with a single call.
   
   Parameters:
   
   rvec    (Input) Specifies whether Ritz vectors corresponding to the
   Ritz value approximations to the eigenproblem A*z = lambda*B*z
   are computed.
   rvec = false: Compute Ritz values only.
   rvec = true : Compute Ritz vectors.
   HowMny  (Input) Specifies how many Ritz vectors are wanted and the
   form of Z, the matrix of Ritz vectors. See remark 1 below.
   The only option already implemented is HowMny = 'A'.
   d       (Output) Array of dimension nev. On exit, d contains the Ritz
   value approximations to the eigenvalues of A*z = lambda*B*z.
   The values are returned in ascending order. If iparam[7] =
   3, 4, 5 then d represents the Ritz values of OP computed by
   dsaupp transformed to those of the original eigensystem A*z =
   lambda*B*z. If iparam[7] = 1,2 then the Ritz values of OP are
   the same as the those of A*z = lambda*B*z.
   Z       (Output) Array of dimension nev*n if HowMny = 'A'. On
   exit, Z contains the B-orthonormal Ritz vectors of the
   eigensystem A*z = lambda*B*z corresponding to the Ritz value
   approximations. If  rvec = false then Z is not referenced.
   NOTE: The array Z may be set equal to first nev columns of
   the Arnoldi/Lanczos basis array V computed by dsaupp.
   ldz     (Input) Dimension of the vectors contained in Z. This
   parameter MUST be set to n.
   sigma   (Input) If iparam[7] = 3,4,5 represents the shift. Not
   referenced if iparam[7] = 1 or 2.
   workl   (Input / Output) Array of length lworkl+1.
   workl[1:4*ncv] contains information obtained in saupp.
   They are not changed by seupp. workl[4*ncv+1:ncv*(ncv+8)]
   holds the untransformed Ritz values, the computed error
   estimates, and the associated eigenvector matrix of H.
   Note: ipntr[8:10] contains the pointer into workl for
   addresses of the above information computed by seupp.
   ipntr   (Input / Output) Array of length 12. Pointer to mark the
   starting locations in the workl array for matrices/vectors
   used by dsaupp and seupp.
   ipntr[8] : pointer to the RITZ values of the original system.
   ipntr[9] : pointer to the ncv corresponding error bounds.
   ipntr[10]: pointer to the ncv by ncv matrix of eigenvectors
   of the tridiagonal matrix T. Only referenced by

   accuracy.
   = -15: HowMny must be one of 'A' or 'S' if rvec = true.
   = -16: HowMny = 'S' not yet implemented.

   bmat, n, which, nev, tol, resid, ncv, V, ldv, iparam,

   Remarks
   1. The converged Ritz values are always returned in increasing

   c\BeginDoc

   c\Name: dnaupd
   c
   c\Description: 
   c  Reverse communication interface for the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi
   c  iteration. This subroutine computes approximations to a few eigenpairs 
   c  of a linear operator "OP" with respect to a semi-inner product defined by 
   c  a symmetric positive semi-definite real matrix B. B may be the identity 
   c  matrix. NOTE: If the linear operator "OP" is real and symmetric 
   c  with respect to the real positive semi-definite symmetric matrix B, 
   c  i.e. B*OP = (OP`)*B, then subroutine dsaupd should be used instead.
   c
   c  The computed approximate eigenvalues are called Ritz values and
   c  the corresponding approximate eigenvectors are called Ritz vectors.
   c
   c  dnaupd is usually called iteratively to solve one of the 
   c  following problems:
   c
   c  Mode 1:  A*x = lambda*x.
   c           ===> OP = A  and  B = I.
   c
   c  Mode 2:  A*x = lambda*M*x, M symmetric positive definite
   c           ===> OP = inv[M]*A  and  B = M.
   c           ===> (If M can be factored see remark 3 below)
   c
   c  Mode 3:  A*x = lambda*M*x, M symmetric semi-definite
   c           ===> OP = Real_Part{ inv[A - sigma*M]*M }  and  B = M. 
   c           ===> shift-and-invert mode (in real arithmetic)
   c           If OP*x = amu*x, then 
   c           amu = 1/2 * [ 1/(lambda-sigma) + 1/(lambda-conjg(sigma)) ].
   c           Note: If sigma is real, i.e. imaginary part of sigma is zero;
   c                 Real_Part{ inv[A - sigma*M]*M } == inv[A - sigma*M]*M 
   c                 amu == 1/(lambda-sigma). 
   c  
   c  Mode 4:  A*x = lambda*M*x, M symmetric semi-definite
   c           ===> OP = Imaginary_Part{ inv[A - sigma*M]*M }  and  B = M. 
   c           ===> shift-and-invert mode (in real arithmetic)
   c           If OP*x = amu*x, then 
   c           amu = 1/2i * [ 1/(lambda-sigma) - 1/(lambda-conjg(sigma)) ].
   c
   c  Both mode 3 and 4 give the same enhancement to eigenvalues close to
   c  the (complex) shift sigma.  However, as lambda goes to infinity,
   c  the operator OP in mode 4 dampens the eigenvalues more strongly than
   c  does OP defined in mode 3.
   c
   c  NOTE: The action of w <- inv[A - sigma*M]*v or w <- inv[M]*v
   c        should be accomplished either by a direct method
   c        using a sparse matrix factorization and solving
   c
   c           [A - sigma*M]*w = v  or M*w = v,
   c
   c        or through an iterative method for solving these
   c        systems.  If an iterative method is used, the
   c        convergence test must be more stringent than
   c        the accuracy requirements for the eigenvalue
   c        approximations.
   c
   c\Usage:
   c  call dnaupd
   c     ( IDO, BMAT, N, WHICH, NEV, TOL, RESID, NCV, V, LDV, IPARAM,
   c       IPNTR, WORKD, WORKL, LWORKL, INFO )
   c
   c\Arguments
   c  IDO     Integer.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
   c          Reverse communication flag.  IDO must be zero on the first 
   c          call to dnaupd.  IDO will be set internally to
   c          indicate the type of operation to be performed.  Control is
   c          then given back to the calling routine which has the
   c          responsibility to carry out the requested operation and call
   c          dnaupd with the result.  The operand is given in
   c          WORKD(IPNTR(1)), the result must be put in WORKD(IPNTR(2)).
   c          -------------------------------------------------------------
   c          IDO =  0: first call to the reverse communication interface
   c          IDO = -1: compute  Y = OP * X  where
   c                    IPNTR(1) is the pointer into WORKD for X,
   c                    IPNTR(2) is the pointer into WORKD for Y.
   c                    This is for the initialization phase to force the
   c                    starting vector into the range of OP.
   c          IDO =  1: compute  Y = OP * X  where
   c                    IPNTR(1) is the pointer into WORKD for X,
   c                    IPNTR(2) is the pointer into WORKD for Y.
   c                    In mode 3 and 4, the vector B * X is already
   c                    available in WORKD(ipntr(3)).  It does not
   c                    need to be recomputed in forming OP * X.
   c          IDO =  2: compute  Y = B * X  where
   c                    IPNTR(1) is the pointer into WORKD for X,
   c                    IPNTR(2) is the pointer into WORKD for Y.
   c          IDO =  3: compute the IPARAM(8) real and imaginary parts 
   c                    of the shifts where INPTR(14) is the pointer
   c                    into WORKL for placing the shifts. See Remark
   c                    5 below.

   c             
   c  BMAT    Character*1.  (INPUT)
   c          BMAT specifies the type of the matrix B that defines the
   c          semi-inner product for the operator OP.
   c          BMAT = 'I' -> standard eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*x
   c          BMAT = 'G' -> generalized eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*B*x
   c
   c  N       Integer.  (INPUT)
   c          Dimension of the eigenproblem.
   c
   c  WHICH   Character*2.  (INPUT)
   c          'LM' -> want the NEV eigenvalues of largest magnitude.
   c          'SM' -> want the NEV eigenvalues of smallest magnitude.
   c          'LR' -> want the NEV eigenvalues of largest real part.
   c          'SR' -> want the NEV eigenvalues of smallest real part.
   c          'LI' -> want the NEV eigenvalues of largest imaginary part.
   c          'SI' -> want the NEV eigenvalues of smallest imaginary part.
   c
   c  NEV     Integer.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
   c          Number of eigenvalues of OP to be computed. 0 < NEV < N-1.
   c
   c  TOL     Double precision scalar.  (INPUT)
   c          Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of the Ritz value 
   c          is considered acceptable if BOUNDS(I) .LE. TOL*ABS(RITZ(I))
   c          where ABS(RITZ(I)) is the magnitude when RITZ(I) is complex.
   c          DEFAULT = DLAMCH('EPS')  (machine precision as computed
   c                    by the LAPACK auxiliary subroutine DLAMCH).
   c
   c  RESID   Double precision array of length N.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
   c          On INPUT: 
   c          If INFO .EQ. 0, a random initial residual vector is used.
   c          If INFO .NE. 0, RESID contains the initial residual vector,
   c                          possibly from a previous run.
   c          On OUTPUT:
   c          RESID contains the final residual vector.
   c
   c  NCV     Integer.  (INPUT)
   c          Number of columns of the matrix V. NCV must satisfy the two
   c          inequalities 2 <= NCV-NEV and NCV <= N.
   c          This will indicate how many Arnoldi vectors are generated 
   c          at each iteration.  After the startup phase in which NEV 
   c          Arnoldi vectors are generated, the algorithm generates 
   c          approximately NCV-NEV Arnoldi vectors at each subsequent update 
   c          iteration. Most of the cost in generating each Arnoldi vector is 
   c          in the matrix-vector operation OP*x. 
   c          NOTE: 2 <= NCV-NEV in order that complex conjugate pairs of Ritz 
   c          values are kept together. (See remark 4 below)
   c
   c  V       Double precision array N by NCV.  (OUTPUT)
   c          Contains the final set of Arnoldi basis vectors. 
   c
   c  LDV     Integer.  (INPUT)
   c          Leading dimension of V exactly as declared in the calling program.
   c
   c  IPARAM  Integer array of length 11.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
   c          IPARAM(1) = ISHIFT: method for selecting the implicit shifts.
   c          The shifts selected at each iteration are used to restart
   c          the Arnoldi iteration in an implicit fashion.
   c          -------------------------------------------------------------
   c          ISHIFT = 0: the shifts are provided by the user via
   c                      reverse communication.  The real and imaginary
   c                      parts of the NCV eigenvalues of the Hessenberg
   c                      matrix H are returned in the part of the WORKL 
   c                      array corresponding to RITZR and RITZI. See remark 
   c                      5 below.
   c          ISHIFT = 1: exact shifts with respect to the current
   c                      Hessenberg matrix H.  This is equivalent to 
   c                      restarting the iteration with a starting vector
   c                      that is a linear combination of approximate Schur
   c                      vectors associated with the "wanted" Ritz values.

   c
   c          IPARAM(4) = NB: blocksize to be used in the recurrence.
   c          The code currently works only for NB = 1.
   c
   c          IPARAM(5) = NCONV: number of "converged" Ritz values.
   c          This represents the number of Ritz values that satisfy
   c          the convergence criterion.
   c
   c          IPARAM(6) = IUPD
   c          No longer referenced. Implicit restarting is ALWAYS used.  
   c
   c          IPARAM(7) = MODE
   c          On INPUT determines what type of eigenproblem is being solved.
   c          Must be 1,2,3,4; See under \Description of dnaupd for the 
   c          four modes available.
   c
   c          IPARAM(8) = NP
   c          When ido = 3 and the user provides shifts through reverse
   c          communication (IPARAM(1)=0), dnaupd returns NP, the number
   c          of shifts the user is to provide. 0 < NP <=NCV-NEV. See Remark
   c          5 below.
   c
   c          IPARAM(9) = NUMOP, IPARAM(10) = NUMOPB, IPARAM(11) = NUMREO,
   c          OUTPUT: NUMOP  = total number of OP*x operations,

   c          Distributed array to be used in the basic Arnoldi iteration
   c          for reverse communication.  The user should not use WORKD 
   c          as temporary workspace during the iteration. Upon termination
   c          WORKD(1:N) contains B*RESID(1:N). If an invariant subspace
   c          associated with the converged Ritz values is desired, see remark

   c                   factorization.
   c
   c\Remarks
   c  1. The computed Ritz values are approximate eigenvalues of OP. The
   c     selection of WHICH should be made with this in mind when
   c     Mode = 3 and 4.  After convergence, approximate eigenvalues of the
   c     original problem may be obtained with the ARPACK subroutine dneupd.
   c
   c  2. If a basis for the invariant subspace corresponding to the converged Ritz 
   c     values is needed, the user must call dneupd immediately following 
   c     completion of dnaupd. This is new starting with release 2 of ARPACK.
   c
   c  3. If M can be factored into a Cholesky factorization M = LL`
   c     then Mode = 2 should not be selected.  Instead one should use
   c     Mode = 1 with  OP = inv(L)*A*inv(L`).  Appropriate triangular 
   c     linear systems should be solved with L and L` rather
   c     than computing inverses.  After convergence, an approximate
   c     eigenvector z of the original problem is recovered by solving
   c     L`z = x  where x is a Ritz vector of OP.
   c
   c  4. At present there is no a-priori analysis to guide the selection
   c     of NCV relative to NEV.  The only formal requrement is that NCV > NEV + 2.
   c     However, it is recommended that NCV .ge. 2*NEV+1.  If many problems of
   c     the same type are to be solved, one should experiment with increasing
   c     NCV while keeping NEV fixed for a given test problem.  This will 
   c     usually decrease the required number of OP*x operations but it
   c     also increases the work and storage required to maintain the orthogonal
   c     basis vectors.  The optimal "cross-over" with respect to CPU time
   c     is problem dependent and must be determined empirically. 
   c     See Chapter 8 of Reference 2 for further information.
   c
   c  5. When IPARAM(1) = 0, and IDO = 3, the user needs to provide the 
   c     NP = IPARAM(8) real and imaginary parts of the shifts in locations 
   c         real part                  imaginary part
   c         -----------------------    --------------
   c     1   WORKL(IPNTR(14))           WORKL(IPNTR(14)+NP)
   c     2   WORKL(IPNTR(14)+1)         WORKL(IPNTR(14)+NP+1)
   c                        .                          .
   c                        .                          .

   c     NP  WORKL(IPNTR(14)+NP-1)      WORKL(IPNTR(14)+2*NP-1).
   c
   c     Only complex conjugate pairs of shifts may be applied and the pairs 
   c     must be placed in consecutive locations. The real part of the 
   c     eigenvalues of the current upper Hessenberg matrix are located in 
   c     WORKL(IPNTR(6)) through WORKL(IPNTR(6)+NCV-1) and the imaginary part 
   c     in WORKL(IPNTR(7)) through WORKL(IPNTR(7)+NCV-1). They are ordered
   c     according to the order defined by WHICH. The complex conjugate
   c     pairs are kept together and the associated Ritz estimates are located in
   c     WORKL(IPNTR(8)), WORKL(IPNTR(8)+1), ... , WORKL(IPNTR(8)+NCV-1).

   c\Name: dneupd 
   c
   c\Description: 
   c
   c  This subroutine returns the converged approximations to eigenvalues
   c  of A*z = lambda*B*z and (optionally):
   c
   c      (1) The corresponding approximate eigenvectors;
   c
   c      (2) An orthonormal basis for the associated approximate
   c          invariant subspace;
   c
   c      (3) Both.
   c
   c  There is negligible additional cost to obtain eigenvectors.  An orthonormal
   c  basis is always computed.  There is an additional storage cost of n*nev
   c  if both are requested (in this case a separate array Z must be supplied).
   c
   c  The approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of  A*z = lambda*B*z
   c  are derived from approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
   c  of the linear operator OP prescribed by the MODE selection in the
   c  call to DNAUPD .  DNAUPD  must be called before this routine is called.
   c  These approximate eigenvalues and vectors are commonly called Ritz
   c  values and Ritz vectors respectively.  They are referred to as such
   c  in the comments that follow.  The computed orthonormal basis for the
   c  invariant subspace corresponding to these Ritz values is referred to as a
   c  Schur basis.
   c
   c  See documentation in the header of the subroutine DNAUPD  for 
   c  definition of OP as well as other terms and the relation of computed
   c  Ritz values and Ritz vectors of OP with respect to the given problem
   c  A*z = lambda*B*z.  For a brief description, see definitions of 
   c  IPARAM(7), MODE and WHICH in the documentation of DNAUPD .
   c
   c\Usage:
   c  call dneupd  
   c     ( RVEC, HOWMNY, SELECT, DR, DI, Z, LDZ, SIGMAR, SIGMAI, WORKEV, BMAT, 
   c       N, WHICH, NEV, TOL, RESID, NCV, V, LDV, IPARAM, IPNTR, WORKD, WORKL, 
   c       LWORKL, INFO )
   c
   c\Arguments:
   c  RVEC    LOGICAL  (INPUT) 
   c          Specifies whether a basis for the invariant subspace corresponding 
   c          to the converged Ritz value approximations for the eigenproblem 
   c          A*z = lambda*B*z is computed.
   c
   c             RVEC = .FALSE.     Compute Ritz values only.
   c
   c             RVEC = .TRUE.      Compute the Ritz vectors or Schur vectors.
   c                                See Remarks below. 
   c 
   c  HOWMNY  Character*1  (INPUT) 
   c          Specifies the form of the basis for the invariant subspace 
   c          corresponding to the converged Ritz values that is to be computed.
   c
   c          = 'A': Compute NEV Ritz vectors; 
   c          = 'P': Compute NEV Schur vectors;
   c          = 'S': compute some of the Ritz vectors, specified
   c                 by the logical array SELECT.
   c
   c  SELECT  Logical array of dimension NCV.  (INPUT)
   c          If HOWMNY = 'S', SELECT specifies the Ritz vectors to be
   c          computed. To select the Ritz vector corresponding to a
   c          Ritz value (DR(j), DI(j)), SELECT(j) must be set to .TRUE.. 
   c          If HOWMNY = 'A' or 'P', SELECT is used as internal workspace.
   c
   c  DR      Double precision  array of dimension NEV+1.  (OUTPUT)
   c          If IPARAM(7) = 1,2 or 3 and SIGMAI=0.0  then on exit: DR contains 
   c          the real part of the Ritz  approximations to the eigenvalues of 
   c          A*z = lambda*B*z. 
   c          If IPARAM(7) = 3, 4 and SIGMAI is not equal to zero, then on exit:
   c          DR contains the real part of the Ritz values of OP computed by 
   c          DNAUPD . A further computation must be performed by the user
   c          to transform the Ritz values computed for OP by DNAUPD  to those
   c          of the original system A*z = lambda*B*z. See remark 3 below.
   c
   c  DI      Double precision  array of dimension NEV+1.  (OUTPUT)
   c          On exit, DI contains the imaginary part of the Ritz value 
   c          approximations to the eigenvalues of A*z = lambda*B*z associated
   c          with DR.
   c
   c          NOTE: When Ritz values are complex, they will come in complex 
   c                conjugate pairs.  If eigenvectors are requested, the 
   c                corresponding Ritz vectors will also come in conjugate 
   c                pairs and the real and imaginary parts of these are 
   c                represented in two consecutive columns of the array Z 
   c                (see below).
   c
   c  Z       Double precision  N by NEV+1 array if RVEC = .TRUE. and HOWMNY = 'A'. (OUTPUT)
   c          On exit, if RVEC = .TRUE. and HOWMNY = 'A', then the columns of 
   c          Z represent approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) corresponding 
   c          to the NCONV=IPARAM(5) Ritz values for eigensystem 
   c          A*z = lambda*B*z. 
   c 
   c          The complex Ritz vector associated with the Ritz value 
   c          with positive imaginary part is stored in two consecutive 
   c          columns.  The first column holds the real part of the Ritz 
   c          vector and the second column holds the imaginary part.  The 
   c          Ritz vector associated with the Ritz value with negative 
   c          imaginary part is simply the complex conjugate of the Ritz vector 
   c          associated with the positive imaginary part.
   c
   c          If  RVEC = .FALSE. or HOWMNY = 'P', then Z is not referenced.
   c
   c          NOTE: If if RVEC = .TRUE. and a Schur basis is not required,
   c          the array Z may be set equal to first NEV+1 columns of the Arnoldi
   c          basis array V computed by DNAUPD .  In this case the Arnoldi basis
   c          will be destroyed and overwritten with the eigenvector basis.
   c
   c  LDZ     Integer.  (INPUT)
   c          The leading dimension of the array Z.  If Ritz vectors are
   c          desired, then  LDZ >= max( 1, N ).  In any case,  LDZ >= 1.
   c
   c  SIGMAR  Double precision   (INPUT)
   c          If IPARAM(7) = 3 or 4, represents the real part of the shift. 
   c          Not referenced if IPARAM(7) = 1 or 2.
   c
   c  SIGMAI  Double precision   (INPUT)
   c          If IPARAM(7) = 3 or 4, represents the imaginary part of the shift. 
   c          Not referenced if IPARAM(7) = 1 or 2. See remark 3 below.
   c
   c  WORKEV  Double precision  work array of dimension 3*NCV.  (WORKSPACE)
   c
   c  **** The remaining arguments MUST be the same as for the   ****
   c  **** call to DNAUPD  that was just completed.               ****
   c
   c  NOTE: The remaining arguments
   c
   c           BMAT, N, WHICH, NEV, TOL, RESID, NCV, V, LDV, IPARAM, IPNTR,
   c           WORKD, WORKL, LWORKL, INFO
   c
   c         must be passed directly to DNEUPD  following the last call
   c         to DNAUPD .  These arguments MUST NOT BE MODIFIED between
   c         the the last call to DNAUPD  and the call to DNEUPD .
   c
   c  Three of these parameters (V, WORKL, INFO) are also output parameters:
   c
   c  V       Double precision  N by NCV array.  (INPUT/OUTPUT)
   c
   c          Upon INPUT: the NCV columns of V contain the Arnoldi basis
   c                      vectors for OP as constructed by DNAUPD  .
   c
   c          Upon OUTPUT: If RVEC = .TRUE. the first NCONV=IPARAM(5) columns
   c                       contain approximate Schur vectors that span the
   c                       desired invariant subspace.  See Remark 2 below.
   c
   c          NOTE: If the array Z has been set equal to first NEV+1 columns
   c          of the array V and RVEC=.TRUE. and HOWMNY= 'A', then the
   c          Arnoldi basis held by V has been overwritten by the desired
   c          Ritz vectors.  If a separate array Z has been passed then
   c          the first NCONV=IPARAM(5) columns of V will contain approximate
   c          Schur vectors that span the desired invariant subspace.
   c
   c  WORKL   Double precision  work array of length LWORKL.  (OUTPUT/WORKSPACE)
   c          WORKL(1:ncv*ncv+3*ncv) contains information obtained in
   c          dnaupd .  They are not changed by dneupd .
   c          WORKL(ncv*ncv+3*ncv+1:3*ncv*ncv+6*ncv) holds the
   c          real and imaginary part of the untransformed Ritz values,
   c          the upper quasi-triangular matrix for H, and the
   c          associated matrix representation of the invariant subspace for H.
   c
   c          Note: IPNTR(9:13) contains the pointer into WORKL for addresses
   c          of the above information computed by dneupd .
   c          -------------------------------------------------------------
   c          IPNTR(9):  pointer to the real part of the NCV RITZ values of the
   c                     original system.
   c          IPNTR(10): pointer to the imaginary part of the NCV RITZ values of
   c                     the original system.
   c          IPNTR(11): pointer to the NCV corresponding error bounds.
   c          IPNTR(12): pointer to the NCV by NCV upper quasi-triangular
   c                     Schur matrix for H.
   c          IPNTR(13): pointer to the NCV by NCV matrix of eigenvectors
   c                     of the upper Hessenberg matrix H. Only referenced by
   c                     dneupd  if RVEC = .TRUE. See Remark 2 below.
   c          -------------------------------------------------------------
   c
   c  INFO    Integer.  (OUTPUT)

   c
   c          =  0: Normal exit.

   c          =  1: The Schur form computed by LAPACK routine dlahqr 
   c                could not be reordered by LAPACK routine dtrsen .
   c                Re-enter subroutine dneupd  with IPARAM(5)=NCV and 
   c                increase the size of the arrays DR and DI to have 
   c                dimension at least dimension NCV and allocate at least NCV 
   c                columns for Z. NOTE: Not necessary if Z and V share 
   c                the same space. Please notify the authors if this error
   c                occurs.
   c
   c          = -1: N must be positive.
   c          = -2: NEV must be positive.
   c          = -3: NCV-NEV >= 2 and less than or equal to N.

   c\Remarks
   c
   c  1. Currently only HOWMNY = 'A' and 'P' are implemented.
   c
   c     Let trans(X) denote the transpose of X.
   c
   c  2. Schur vectors are an orthogonal representation for the basis of
   c     Ritz vectors. Thus, their numerical properties are often superior.
   c     If RVEC = .TRUE. then the relationship
   c             A * V(:,1:IPARAM(5)) = V(:,1:IPARAM(5)) * T, and
   c     trans(V(:,1:IPARAM(5))) * V(:,1:IPARAM(5)) = I are approximately 
   c     satisfied. Here T is the leading submatrix of order IPARAM(5) of the 
   c     real upper quasi-triangular matrix stored workl(ipntr(12)). That is,
   c     T is block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; 
   c     each 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
   c     off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.  Corresponding to each 2-by-2
   c     diagonal block is a complex conjugate pair of Ritz values. The real
   c     Ritz values are stored on the diagonal of T.
   c
   c  3. If IPARAM(7) = 3 or 4 and SIGMAI is not equal zero, then the user must
   c     form the IPARAM(5) Rayleigh quotients in order to transform the Ritz
   c     values computed by DNAUPD  for OP to those of A*z = lambda*B*z. 
   c     Set RVEC = .true. and HOWMNY = 'A', and
   c     compute 
   c           trans(Z(:,I)) * A * Z(:,I) if DI(I) = 0.
   c     If DI(I) is not equal to zero and DI(I+1) = - D(I), 
   c     then the desired real and imaginary parts of the Ritz value are
   c           trans(Z(:,I)) * A * Z(:,I) +  trans(Z(:,I+1)) * A * Z(:,I+1),
   c           trans(Z(:,I)) * A * Z(:,I+1) -  trans(Z(:,I+1)) * A * Z(:,I), 
   c     respectively.
   c     Another possibility is to set RVEC = .true. and HOWMNY = 'P' and
   c     compute trans(V(:,1:IPARAM(5))) * A * V(:,1:IPARAM(5)) and then an upper
   c     quasi-triangular matrix of order IPARAM(5) is computed. See remark
   c     2 above.
