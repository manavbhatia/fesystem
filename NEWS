Tagged the current code as "FESystem-1-2", and created a second branch in the "FESystem-1-0" root. The previous branch was "FESystem-1-0-branch" (essentially "FESystem-1-1"), which will now be avilable only for maintenance. The first maintenance release was created for this branch and was tagged "FESystem-1-0-branch-release-2".

The addition of transient analysis will happen in the "FESystem-1-2" branch.
